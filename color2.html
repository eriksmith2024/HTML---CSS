<h2> The composition of Seawater </h2>

<p> Almost anything can be found in seawater, 
    this includes dissolved materials from the earths crust
    as well as materials released from organisms. The most 
    important components of seawater that influence life forms 
    are salinity, temperature dissolved gasses (mostly oxygen and
    carbon dioxide), nutrients and pH. These elements vary in their 
    composition as well as their influence on marine life.
